# Competitive Quiplash Scoring System

A lightweight React + Vite scoring system web app template — the codebase for the "Scoring System" project. It includes a minimal React setup powered by Vite, ESLint, and a small app scaffold in `src/`.

## Key Features

- Modern front-end stack: React + Vite for fast dev server and builds
- ESLint configuration for consistent code style
- Tiny, easy-to-extend starter structure for building scoring or dashboard apps

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm (or yarn)
- Git (for cloning and version control)

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server (Hot Module Replacement enabled)

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Preview the production build locally

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Available NPM Scripts

- `dev` — start Vite dev server
- `build` — build production assets
- `preview` — preview the production build locally
- (add `lint` or `test` if you add tooling later)

## Project Structure (high level)

- `index.html` — app entry HTML
- `package.json` — scripts & dependencies
- `vite.config.js` — Vite config
- `src/` — React source files
	- `src/main.jsx` — app bootstrap
	- `src/App.jsx` — main app component
	- `src/assets/` — images/icons

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Make changes and run the dev server locally
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change

If you want help with CI, tests, or adding TypeScript, I can add them.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see authentication errors when pushing, configure `gh auth login`, use an SSH key, or create a GitHub Personal Access Token and configure your git credential manager.

## License

Specify your project license here (e.g., MIT) or contact the repo owner for details.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a short usage example or demo data
- Add a contributor guide or issue templates
- Add CI workflow for builds and previews

Tell me which of these you'd like next.
